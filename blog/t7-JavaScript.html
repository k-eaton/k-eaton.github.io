	<h2>Ruby vs JavaScript</h2>

		I like JavaScript.  Code Academy's JavaScript program was my first introduction to coding.  But then I learned Ruby.  (And everything I knew about JavaScript drained right out of my brain.)  Now that we're back to JavaScript I was stunned to discover how limited it feels compared to Ruby for simple tasks.  This is because Ruby has so many specialized methods to make your life easier.  If you want these tools in JavaScript, it seems you have to build them yourself.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is not necessarily a bad thing, but comparatively speaking, it takes more time to handle simple operations.  Take iteration for example.  Ruby has an entire class of methods devoted to it. (The Enumeration class.) JavaScript has a few functions available, but most everything I read suggested that if you wanted to iterate over something like an array, the for loop was the way to go.
	</p>
	<p>
		It was suggested by one page that Ruby is like having a toolbox of many tools that do their jobs well.  JavaScript is like a leather sheath with a really, REALLY sharp knife inside.  What this suggests to me is the idea that while Ruby has the tools you need for most projects, if you have to "carve" your own, you're probably going to want that sharp knife.
	</p>
	<p>
		My take away is simply that they're two very different languages, not really in competition with each other, just one easier to use for some tasks and the other for others.
