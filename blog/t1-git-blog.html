		Everyone has to start somewhere. At DBC we start with version control, specifically using git and GitHub.  If this sounds like total gibberish, you're in the right place.  (If you know what this is, sorry for how I'm about to butcher this.)
		</p>
		<p>
		Let's start with version control.  Version control is the act of making backups.  It's the equivalent of saving frequently, except each prior save is kept (along with a brief description of what changed) for future reference.  Example: you've written a chapter of your future best-seller, and you save it with version control software (in this case, git).  Three chapters down the road you decide that you shouldn't have killed off the romantic interest in chapter 2.  So you change it. But a few rewrites later, you realize the romantic interest sucks, and really needs to go in chapter 2.  With version control, you have the option of reverting to that particular save file.  No matter what you added or deleted, if you saved using git, you can revert to the original work.
		</p>
		<p>

		This is a really powerful tool as not only can you revert when you make a mistake, you can branch off and try things out without ruining your master copy.  Perhaps two romantic interests would be better.  But you're not sure.  You can do a test run with the new idea, and if it works, keep it, and if it doesn't, you still have an untouched original.
		</p>
		<p>

		But what happens when your cat decides to be a total dick and knock a glass of water over onto your laptop?
		</p>
		<p>

		This is where GitHub comes in.  GitHub is a website, and it's kind of the social media/DropBox of version control.  One use for it is to link your local folders to folders you create on the website.  When you save your files locally (a process called a "commit" in git) you can also "push" your files up to GitHub.  This gives you an off site backup.

		</p>
		<p>
		But wait!  There's more!
		</p>
		<p>

		Say your friend has this brilliant idea about how one of the romantic interests dies in a glorious fireball of doom, leaving a pile of carnage and a distraught main character.  Your friend can "fork" off a copy of the files, and edit them.  These edits do not change your original files.  The files can then be uploaded back to the master copy (called a "master branch") for you to evaluate.  You can then choose to merge in the new material or not.
		</p>
		<p>

		Version control is a powerful tool, and worth looking into.  (There's other version control software out there, but git and GitHub are the ones I'm learning about.)  Now get out there and write your magnum opus!  Just don't forget to commit your files and push them up to the server frequently!
