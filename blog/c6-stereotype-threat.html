	<h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>

		Stereotype threat is something we've all felt at one time or another: when you're put in a position of possibly being compared to a stereotype.  The black child told that the test is a measure of intelligence my feel like he has to prove himself because otherwise he might live up to the sterotype that blacks aren't as smart as whites.  The problem is, when you feel pressured like that, you don't perform as well on the test, thus creating a self fullfilling prophecy.  Women aren't supposed to do as well on math or science tests.  White men can feel it when compared to the Asians excel at math stereotype.
	</p>
	<p>
		In other words, sterotypes suck.
	</p>
	<p>
		My personal experiences with stereotype threat have ranged from the subtle (girls just aren't good at chemistry) to the not so subtle. (My father listening to me say I was interested in astrophysics, and then asking me what some of my theories were, and dismissing me when I didn't have any.  I was 13.  A few years later he told me he was concerned about me studying physics, or chemistry, or computer science because I might be the only girl there.  There's a reason I'm in therapy.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Instances like this leave deep marks.  Even now when I get truly stuck on a problem or a low test score, I begin to think I'm not smart enough to do this program.  The worst though is when you actually live up to the stereotype.  It becomes self-reenforcing, creating a downward spiral.
	</p>
	<p>
		Careful reframing of tests and assignments can help combat this.  Studies have found that telling black students that a test is simply a problem to be solved and not a test of intellegence have dramatically increased scores.  Supportive environments can help make "forbidden" fields of study more available to women.  And awareness of sterotypes in general is important in combatting this problem.
