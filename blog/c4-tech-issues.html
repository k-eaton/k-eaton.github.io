	<h2>Women in Technology</h2>

		As of 2012, 26% of the tech industry was comprised of women, 18% of computer science majors were women, and 11% of executive positions at privately held companies were filled by women.  Not exactly impressive statistics.  (Better than the minorities in technology statistics though.  Those are WAY worse.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Partially this is because of lack of potential. Early STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) education is severly lacking in primary and secondary schooling, especially in the realm of support for girls to pursue their interest in it.  
	</p>
	<p>
		But the limitations don't stop as women get older.  There is still this pervasive idea that women are by default a poor hiring choice because of the notion that if they don't already have children, they will plan on having them.  This influences hiring practices, and raises questions for women in the tech industry.  What would having a child do to their career?  This is such an industry issue that Facebook recently offered to pay for female employees to have eggs frozen so they could put off having children until they were older.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some people theorize that part of the problem is that women don't realize that they can combine their other interests with careers in technology.  I cordially disagree.  In my personal experience there is still plenty of pressure for girls to stay away from technology related fields.  There's also the perception that being in the field of technology requires being extremely intelligent (I think we're running into the issue of a fixed mindset here).  I can't tell you how many people have responded to me telling them I'm doing this by saying, "wow, you must be really smart!" Culturally speaking, we don't encourage girls to be smart, especially in STEM fields.
	</p>
	<p>
		The issues are even more complex than the tiny bit I've commented on here.  But suffice to say, it's going to take a lot of work and effort to balance out the gender ratio in the technology field.
