		I’m afraid of failing.  The idea scares the ever living crap out of me.  From the stand point of a fixed versus growth mindset, this is not a good thing.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Let’s start over.
	</p>
	<p>
		Growth vs fixed mindsets.  According to Dr. Carol Dweck’s research, there are essentially two ways that we think about our personalities. (This is not the same as describing one’s personality, just how we, as people, think about what our personalities are.)  One version is a growth mindset, the other is fixed.  The fixed mindset believes that intelligence is static, while the growth mindset believes intelligence can be developed.  There’s a WHOLE bunch of inferences one can make from this one belief.  One broad one is that if you have a fixed mindset, and want to look smart then you pretty much have to avoid challenges you can’t pass, and above all else, failure at any cost.  If you have a growth mindset, you see challenges and even failure as learning opportunities.
	</p>
	<p>
		I do not easily fall into the latter category.
	</p>
	<p>
		But I need to.
	</p>
	<p>
		For as long as I can remember, failure was to be avoided.  In college, I’d fail classes by choice, rather than take the class and possibly fail because I wasn’t smart enough.  It took a long time to break myself of that habit.  I finally learned how to force myself to take a chance, and ask for help when I needed it when I got a job, and couldn’t just dodge the parts of the position I didn’t think I could do.  In a way that’s one of the best things that’s ever happened to me.  It’s expanded my world, allowing me to learn things in a more tactile way, which happens to be one of the ways I learn best.  (This all would have been really nice to know in college.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Failure happens.  If you let it be, it can be an incredible learning experience.  So far I’ve learned to fail at coding and obtain more knowledge from the experience.  I’m learning a lot from it.  Partially that’s because Dev Bootcamp just sort of throws us all into the mix, tells us to be nice to each other, and to go for it.  And amazingly enough, it works.  Because none of us knows what we’re doing, it’s okay to say “I don’t know”.   Frequently, there seems to be a person who has somehow figured it out.  As an Abstract Random thinker, I’m thriving in this environment.  (We’ve now branched into another way of looking at personality and learning types, the Gregorc   model.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Abstract Random thinkers like to play well with others, and learn in less restrictive environments.  Phase 0 of DBC seems to be perfect for this.  There’s lots of room to learn, there’s lots of people to interact with, and there isn’t a lot of competition.  That last one is what makes it safe to fail.  And by failing we learn.  And get better.  And smarter.  And eventually, we’ll succeed.
