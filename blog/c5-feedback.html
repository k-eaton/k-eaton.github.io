		As someone whose idea of group work was each person do their individual part and we'll reconvene after everyone's done, pair programming was a bit of a culture shock.  I found it to be really rewarding when on my second pair programming experience we blasted through a project that probably would have taken us three to four hours alone, and completed it in 90 minutes.  After that I was hooked.  I still find dedicated driving and navigating a bit cumbersome, I prefer to have my partner and I switch more organically, depending on who knows what we need at any given moment.

		Getting the feedback has been nice, if not always the most useful thing in the world.  At heart, the base problem is that no one wants to be mean, and that gets confused with providing constructive criticism.  I know that that's a mistake I make all the time. The biggest issue I have with giving feedback is listing actionable items.  I tend to think that if we got through the exercise, and the experience wasn't horrible, then clearly the other person knows what they are doing, and don't really need to change.

		I know that's not really helping my partners, and I don't mean to do them a disservice, it's just a weak spot of mine.
	</p>
	<p>
		I like the feedback system, especially when there is something actionable in the feedback. (There's irony.)  I also appreciate the part where we check the feedback for kindness.  No one needs something mindlessly painful as feedback. (I can't imagine anyone being actually cruel in this group, just possibly oblivious to when something isn't kind.)  Overall it seems to work.
