		Soooooo... At the end of chapter 7 of Chris Pine's <a href="http://www.ebooks-it.net/ebook/learn-to-program-2nd-edition">Learn to Program</a> is an exercise where you create a program where you talk to Grandma who is hard of hearing.  The initial program is really simple, then he proposes a few changes that increase the complexity slightly.  I thought it was cute, and sounded like fun, so I did the challenge.  And lo and behold, I got the damn thing to work!  Even the extended challenge part! 
	</p>
	<p>
		But then I realized I couldn't show it to anyone because I don't know how to embed Ruby into web pages yet.  And that's when I fell down the rabbit hole. I spent an hour converting the program into JavaScript and embedding it into a web page... so I can show off my one trick pony Ruby program.
	</p>
	<p>
		So, uh, yeah.  That's it.  Press the button to play. If you've read the exercises at the end of chapter 7, you'll figure out how to end the conversation.  If you haven't figured it out, it involves the word "bye".  Multiple times.  Oh, and it doesn't work if you have pop-ups turned off.  I'd work on that, but I think I've blown WAY too much time on this already...

grandma = function() {
var question = prompt("What would you like to say to grandma?");

var saying = "Now what were you saying?";

while (bye < 3) {
